    Description from [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html]:

    ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) was developed in 1986 by Ross Quinlan. The
    algorithm creates a multiway tree, finding for each node (i.e. in a greedy
    manner) the categorical feature that will yield the largest information gain
    for categorical targets. Trees are grown to their maximum size and then a
    pruning step is usually applied to improve the ability of the tree to
    generalise to unseen data.
